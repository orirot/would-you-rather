# Would You Rather Project
This is an assignment for the Udacity's Nanodegree React Fundamentals course.
This project presents each user with a list of questions he can answer.
Each question has two options and each user can vote to only one of them.
Before the user votes, he cannot see how many voted to each of them.
There's also a leader board that shows who are the most active users (the ones who asked and voted for the most questions overall)
Each user can also add a question so other users can ask it.

The Project isn't connected to any server, it has a dummy data set.
Login is done by solely choosing a user.

Installing
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
